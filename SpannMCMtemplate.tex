%%%%Spann, Gulotta, Kane 2007 summary for the Congressional Redistricting (gerrymandering) problem:

%We propose and evaluate two methods for determining congressional
%districts. The models are defined so that they only explicitly
%contain criteria for population equality and compactness, but we
%show through a detailed analysis that other fairness criteria such
%as contiguity and city integrity are present as emergent properties.

%In the Moment of Inertia Method, districts are created such that
%populations are within $\SizeError$ of the mean district size and
%the sum of the squares of distances between each census tract
%weighted by population size and the district's centroid is
%minimized.  We present a mathematical argument that this model will
%result in districts that are convex.

%In the Diminishing Halves Method, the state is recursively divided
%in half by a line that is perpendicular to the statistical best-fit
%line describing the region's census tracts.

%With the help of a Perl script we are able to parse US Census 2000
%data, extracting the latitude, longitude, and population count of
%each census tract. By parsing data at the census tract level instead
%of the county level, we are able to run our model with high
%precision.  We run our algorithms on census data from the states of
%New York as well as Arizona (small), Illinois (medium), and Texas
%(large).

%We compare the results of our methods to each other and to the
%current districts in the respective states.  Both our algorithms
%return districts that are not only contiguous but also convex, aside
%from borders where the state itself is nonconvex.  We superimpose
%city locations on the district maps to check for community
%integrity. We evaluate our proposed districts with the Inverse Roeck
%Test, the Length-Width Test, and the Schwartzberg Test to obtain
%quantitative measures of compactness.

%The initial conditions do not greatly affect the Moment of Inertia
%Method.  We run additional variants of the Diminishing Halves Method
%and find that they do not improve over our normal method.
%\medskip

%Based on our results, we would like to recommend to states that
%\begin{itemize}
%\item District shapes should be convex.
%\item City boundaries and contiguity can be emergent properties, not explicit considerations.
%\item A good algorithm can handle states of different sizes.
%\item We recommend our Moment of Inertia Method, as it
%consistently performed the best.
%\end{itemize}

\section{Problem Restatement}\label{sec:restate}
%% One quick paragraph describing the problem and foreshadowing your approach.


Searching for a lost plane:

Recall the lost Malaysian flight MH370. Build a generic mathematical model that could assist "searchers" in planning a useful search for a lost plane feared to have crashed in open water such as the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Southern, or Arctic Ocean while flying from Point A to Point B. Assume that there are no signals from the downed plane. Your model should recognize that there are many different types of planes for which we might be searching and that there are many different types of search planes, often using different electronics or sensors. Additionally, prepare a 1-2 page non-technical paper for the airlines to use in their press conferences concerning their plan for future searches.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Uncomment if needed
%\section{Terminology and Conventions}\label{sec:terms}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item \textbf{Term1}. Definition.

%\item \textbf{Term2}.  The problem statement uses the synonym `foo'.

%\item \textbf{Term3}.  We mean the graph theory definition, not the business definition.

%and so on

%\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Assumptions and Assumption Justifications}\label{sec:assumptions}

\textit{About CATEGORY 1}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{The last known state of the lost aircraft is accurate for an interval of 15 minutes to 1 hour}.  The old "Log-on Interrogation" standard interval is 1 hour, while current proposals recommend a change to 15 minutes.
\item \textbf{straightness}.  No maneuver from incident to crash. worse case of engine failure gives average of roughly 11 minutes. no time for intentional changes on the large scale.
\item \textbf{immediate standby}.  Search agents are on edge instantaneously.
%%%Add more items as needed
\end{itemize}

\ \\
\textit{About CATEGORY 2}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{No hijacking}.  Add one-two sentences describing and justifying your assumption.
\item \textbf{All aircrafts operating at MTOW}.  Describe/Justify.
\item \textbf{Standard cruise altitude and cruise speed}.  Describe/Justify.
%%%Add more items as needed

\section{Literature Review}\label{sec:litrev}

%% Maybe this isn't relevant to your paper or you want to just name this section as "INTRODUCTION".  There's a bit of flexibility as to what you can do now, so name this and the next few sections in whatever way fits the flow of your paper.  If convenient, I personally like to give a bit of scholarly journal background in some of my papers, but we don't do that every year depending on how weird the problems are.

\section{Criteria for Optimal Solution}\label{sec:measure}

%% The problem usually doesn't give you a very specific definition for what the ``best'' solution is, so you should clearly explain it.  Feel free to rename this section something more relevant or use a different style and structure for the paper, just make sure you fulfill the goal of defining what the ``best'' solution looks like.



%\newpage

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Describe Your Method}\label{sec:mainmethod}
%% (Change the section title of course)

%% Describe your mathematical model and list all relevant equations.  Remember to make your paper easy to skim by placing variable definitions by all equations.  We prefer to use actual words for variables if that variable will only be used once or twice.  Don't use Greek letters unless your variable is directly analogous to what a Greek letter usually means in math or physics.  Feel free to write important sentences \textbf{in bold} to make your paper easier to skim.


\subsection{Description}\label{subsecmeth:desc}

%% Maybe you want to split this section into subsections.  Just suggesting things here.  Change as you see fit.  
%% By the way, you don't have to fill out the \label{}'s if you don't want to.  They're so you can \ref{} in the middle of the paper then move entire sections around later without breaking your numbering.


\subsection{Mathematical Interpretation}\label{subsecDist:math}

%% Here's quick lesson on equations if you need it:


%%%% A standard numbered equation that you can later \ref{eqn:firstequation}

%\begin{equation}\label{eqn:firstequation}
% Type equation as if it were in between $ $ but you don't need the $.
%\end{equation}



%%%% Use & to split columns in align mode.  The * is optional, makes the equation not have a number.  You can have as many &'s per line as needed.

%\begin{align*}
%Left hand side   &   = Right hand side  \\
%                 &   = Right hand side on line below it\\
%                 &   = Final right hand side
%\end{align*}



\subsection{Comparison to Most Interesting Literature Paper}\label{subsec:hess}

%% Once again, change the sections as you see fit.  

%% Other command suggestions:

\section{Comparison to a Greedy Algorithm}\label{sec:greedyalg}

%%% Besides your main model, always have a ``control'' algorithm to compare to.  It's even better if you can think of an extra ``good'' algorithm as well.  








%\newpage

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Experimental Setup}\label{sec:experiment}
%% State clearly what you are testing.  State your input data and what probability distributions were used in generating it.  Talk a little bit about the implementation of your program (language, if something works a bit differently than the mathematical description you already gave them).  Split into subsections as needed.






%\newpage

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

%% List and describe your simulation results.  Besides the main question that you are being asked, seek other naturally occurring inquiries motivated by the results. Split your results into subsections as appropriate.


%%Here's how you input figures.  You can reference figures with \ref{}.
%%If you don't care about captions or referencing, you only need the %%\includegraphics{} part.


%\begin{figure}[!]  %You can do other options besides [!]
%\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[height=3.2 in]{filename.png}  %[height=] is optional
   %If only using LaTeX instead of PDFLaTeX, you might need to use .eps format 
   %for files and use bounding boxes ([bb]). 
%%Want to have 2 graphs in one figure? Just add another \includegraphics here   
%\caption {Give the figure a caption.}
%\label{fig:firstfigure}
%\end{center}
%\end{figure}







%\newpage

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Sensitivity to Parameters}\label{sec:sensitive}

%% As a test for robustness, tweak some of the parameters to your model to see if the results would be substantially impacted.  You might also want to ask some additional sanity check questions based on the data and answer them.

\section{Strengths and Weaknesses}\label{sec:sandw}
%%  You can write most of this section before 100\% of your results are done if your coding is running a little behind.  It doesn't have to be exactly 5 bullet points, just whatever makes sense given your paper.
